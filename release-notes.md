# Release Notes

## Latest Changes

* Update __init__.py. PR [#44](https://github.com/readyapi/readyapi-cli/pull/44) by [@gitworkflows](https://github.com/gitworkflows).

## 0.0.5

### Breaking Changes

* ‚ôªÔ∏è Add `readyapi-cli[standard]` including Uvicorn, make `readyapi-cli` and `readyapi-cli-slim` have the same packages. PR [#55](https://github.com/readyapi/readyapi-cli/pull/55) by [@khulnasoft](https://github.com/khulnasoft).
* ‚ûï Keep Uvicorn in default dependencies. PR [#57](https://github.com/readyapi/readyapi-cli/pull/57) by [@khulnasoft](https://github.com/khulnasoft).

#### Summary

Install with:

```bash
pip install "readyapi[standard]"
```

Or if for some reason installing only the ReadyAPI CLI:

```bash
pip install "readyapi-cli[standard]"
```

#### Technical Details

Before this, `readyapi-cli` would include Uvicorn and `readyapi-cli-slim` would not include Uvicorn.

In a future version, `readyapi-cli` will not include Uvicorn unless it is installed with `readyapi-cli[standard]`.

ReadyAPI version 0.112.0 has a `readyapi[standard]` and that one includes `readyapi-cli[standard]`.

Before, you would install `pip install readyapi`, or `pip install readyapi-cli`. Now you should include the `standard` optional dependencies (unless you want to exclude one of those): `pip install "readyapi[standard]"`.

In a future version, `readyapi-cli` will not include Uvicorn unless it is installed with `readyapi-cli[standard]`.
